# Mobile Weather
A simple weather app in C++ and QML demonstrating how to talk to REST APIs with Qt

This app was developed for a CS project when I was studying. It very much fulfilled the requirements meaning you can actually search for your city and get a (more or less accurate) weather forecast for the next 5 days.
